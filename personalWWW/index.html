            Hello. My name is Kyle Gifaldi. I am currently a Junior attending the University of Notre Dame, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree?? in computer science. I enjoy computer science for several reasons. 1) computers are used to solve challenging problems that humans can't do efficiently or effectively. In this sense, I look at computers as a tool to further the capabilities of humans. 2) A lot of the work done with computers is inately creative. Someone might have a vision of something that
            they want to create, and computers give that person a way to make their vision a reality. Things like game development, web develeopment, and 3-d modeling are enjoying for this reason. In this sense, I look at computers as a creative medium. 3) There is enough knowlege and skills relevant to the field of computers to last many lifetimes of learning. And since computers are an expanding field, these skills and knowledge are expanding at a crazy rate. In this sense, I look at
            computers as an infinite opportunity to improve and learn. These reasons and others fuel my passion of computers and make me excited everyday to expand my

The generator creates a random walk which ends once it connects to the already-made path. Once a new random walk is generated and connected to the maze, a new random walk is created from
              the branching position. The end product consists of one single path from the start to the end with several branching paths which terminate before the end. Click here to view the source code.</p></div></a>

This scene consists of four separate scenes combined through the magic of video editing. The first scene consists of a galaxy created with the software's particles
              feature. The second scene shows the sun and the earth. The third scene shows an astroid hurtling towards our doomed planet. The asteroids tail was created with the fluids feature of autodesk Maya. The final scene shows the climactic destruction of a lone volcano whose final action was the destruction of its surroundings just as a star dies; destroying any surrounding life.

I created one level in c utilizing the gfx graphics libraries. Within the level, the user playing as mario can move, jump, and throw fire balls. The objective is the reach the castle at the end of the
              level. If the player jumps up into a brown brick, the brick breaks. If the player jumps up into a yellow brick with a question mark, it turns into a brown brick and the player gets points. If the player runs into a goompa???, he loses points. If the player runs into a goompa with 0 points, he loses. Finally, the player can jump on a goompa or hit it with a fire ball which will kill it.
